/**
 * Creates an [AdbSession] to use with Console/Command Line Interface tools,
 * using standard Kotlin dispatchers and JVM stdout/stderr streams for I/O.
 *
 * **Note:** This session acts as a smart client. If an ADB server is not currently
 * running on the localhost, this session will attempt to locate the `adb` executable
 * on the system PATH and start the server automatically.
 *
 * ** WARNING **. Use this function with care. The philosophy of adblib is to have a
 * single AdbSession and a single AdbHost per VM. This is currently used in adblib CLI and
 * deployerlib CLI.
 * Anywhere else, it is very likely you should obtain the Session from where it was already
 * created.

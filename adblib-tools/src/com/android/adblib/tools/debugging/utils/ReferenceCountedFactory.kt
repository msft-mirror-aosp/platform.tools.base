/**
 * A thread-safe reference counting implementation to any resource of type [T]. The resource instance is typically accessed by calling the
 * [withResource] method.
 * * The [retain] method increments the reference count, after creating an instance of the resource using [factory] if current reference
 *   count value was 0.
 * * The [release] method decrements the reference count. If [T] is [AutoCloseable], the resource is [shutdown][AutoShutdown.shutdown]
 *   and/or [closed][AutoCloseable.close] when the reference count reaches 0.
 *
 * This class implements [AutoCloseable] to allow releasing the resource even when there are pending references, so that the resource can be
 * released even if still in use.
